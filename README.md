USAGE:
* bundle install
* export GLASSFROG_KEY=$YOUR_GLASSFROG_KEY
* ruby get_emails "$CIRCLE_NAME_YOU_CARE_ABOUT", where that is the short name. Usually that's the name, sometimes there's a different name in italicized parens.
* or "Faciliators", "Lead Links", "Rep Links", or "Secretaries", that works too

I didn't really test this
